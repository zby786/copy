# Manual Release Test Matrix

Run this matrix before every public release.

Use **Notepad / plain-text editor first**, then test Typora. This separates browser-copy bugs from editor paste behavior.

Record:

- OS
- Browser + version
- Userscript manager + version
- Script version
- Site (ChatGPT / DeepSeek / Kimi / Claude / Gemini / Doubao / Tongyi)

# Multi-site note (v0.2.0+)

Since v0.2.0 the script supports multiple AI chat sites through a `SITE_PROFILES`
adapter table; the conversion core is site-agnostic. Before marking a site as
verified, run at least P0-03, P0-04, P0-05, P0-10, P0-11 and P0-12 on that site.
Currently only ChatGPT and DeepSeek are confirmed; Kimi, Claude, Gemini, Doubao
and Tongyi/Qwen are best-effort and may need selector updates.

If a site silently falls back to native copy, set `CONFIG.debug = true`, inspect a
response container element in DevTools, and fix that site's `containers` in
`SITE_PROFILES`.

# P0 — Release blockers

Every P0 test must pass on a platform before that platform is marked supported.

| ID | Test | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| P0-01 | Copy ordinary Chinese prose | Exact readable text |
| P0-02 | Copy ordinary English prose | Exact readable text |
| P0-03 | Copy prose containing one full inline formula | Formula becomes `$...$` |
| P0-04 | Copy one full display formula only | Formula becomes `$$ ... $$` |
| P0-05 | Copy prose with 5+ mixed formulas | No duplicates, no fragmented glyphs |
| P0-06 | Selection begins exactly at a full formula and continues into prose | Full formula becomes LaTeX |
| P0-07 | Selection ends exactly after a full formula | Full formula becomes LaTeX |
| P0-08 | Select only the left half of a formula | Only selected visual portion is copied; selection is NOT expanded |
| P0-09 | Select only the right half of a formula | Same as P0-08 |
| P0-10 | Select a full formula without surrounding prose | Must still include `$` or `$$` Markdown delimiters |
| P0-11 | Copy a multi-line full code block | Every source line remains on its own line |
| P0-12 | Code contains `$$ not math $$` | It remains literal code |
| P0-13 | Code contains triple backticks | Output fence is long enough not to break |
| P0-14 | Copy partial code only | Native exact visual/code selection; no forced full block |
| P0-15 | Copy inside ChatGPT input box | Native browser copy; userscript must not hijack |
| P0-16 | Copy outside assistant Markdown | Native browser copy |
| P0-17 | Copy across two separate ChatGPT responses | Native browser copy in v0.1.0 |
| P0-18 | No selection + copy | No script exception |
| P0-19 | Set `simulateFailure: true` and copy | Native browser copy still works |
| P0-20 | Restore `simulateFailure: false` | Markdown conversion works again |

# Markdown regression suite

## MD-01 Headings

Test H1 through H4.

## MD-02 Emphasis

- bold
- italic
- strike-through
- bold containing inline math
- italic containing inline math

## MD-03 Lists

- unordered list
- ordered list
- nested list
- list item containing inline math
- list item containing display math

## MD-04 Block quote

Quote containing prose and math.

## MD-05 Links

Normal hyperlink with surrounding prose.

## MD-06 Tables

Test:

- plain table;
- table with formulas;
- table cell containing `|`;
- Chinese table.

## MD-07 Code

Test:

```python
def test():
    x = "$$ not math $$"
    return x
```

Then test code containing:

````text
```markdown
inside = "```"
```
````

# Selection-boundary abuse tests

Intentionally select awkward regions:

1. middle of paragraph → middle of paragraph;
2. middle of heading → middle of paragraph;
3. middle of formula → paragraph end;
4. paragraph start → middle of formula;
5. middle of bold → middle of formula;
6. middle of list item 2 → middle of list item 4;
7. one partial table region;
8. formula only;
9. code only;
10. partial code only.

Expected rule:

> Never silently expand a partial formula or partial code selection to a larger object.

# Clipboard conflict test

Temporarily enable any other clipboard-modifying extension you normally use.

If behavior changes:

1. disable the other extension;
2. retest;
3. record the conflicting extension in the issue.

---

# Long-response stress test

Use one response containing:

- 10,000+ characters;
- 20+ formulas;
- at least one table;
- at least one code block;
- nested lists.

Check:

- no obvious freeze;
- no missing tail;
- no duplicated formulas;
- no code-line collapse.

---

# Privacy/static audit

Search the distributable `.user.js` for:

```text
fetch(
XMLHttpRequest
GM_
WebSocket
sendBeacon
```

Expected: no networking implementation.

Also verify metadata contains:

```text
@grant none
```
